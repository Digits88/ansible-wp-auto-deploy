# GleSYS API/Ansible Demo

This is an automated procedure to:

  * create a server with provided FQDN
  * set DNS record for the specified domain
  * set PTR record to the newly created servers IP
  * install WordPress, base install with Ansible (http://docs.ansible.com)


## Installation


#### Step 1 â€“ API Key

   * create a GleSYS API key with IP, DOMAIN and SERVER privilegies (`Permissions / Allow all on Domain, IP and Server`)
   * use a domain which is maintained on your GleSYS account (record should not pre-exist)


#### Step 2 - Requirements (where you initiate the script)

   * Ansible 2
   * Sshpass
   * PWGen
   * XMLStarlet
   * Curl
   * Python Passlib Library
   * Nmap
   * Git-core

Below are installation instructions for Debian/Ubuntu and MacOS X. However, it's possible to keep on using your preferred OS, just find the above packages and you'll be good to go.


###### Install these on Debian/Ubuntu


	apt-get install python-dev build-essential python-pip pwgen xmlstarlet curl sshpass nmap python-passlib
	pip install ansible


###### Install these on MacOS X (using Homebrew)


	brew install ansible
