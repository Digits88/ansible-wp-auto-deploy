# GleSYS API/Ansible Demo for deplopying a WordPress environment.

This is an automated procedure to:

  * Create and config a database server.
  * Create and config 2 or more web servers.
  * Create and config a loadbalancer to balance the trafic between the web servers.
  * Create and config a file storage valume and share it with the web servers.
  * Install WordPress, base install with Ansible (http://docs.ansible.com)
  * Set DNS record for the specified domain.

..............................................................

## Installation : 

#### Step 1 â€“ API Key
  * create a GleSYS API key with IP, DOMAIN and SERVER privilegies (Permissions / Allow all on Domain, IP, load balancer, filestorage and Server)
  * use a domain which is maintained on your GleSYS project  (record should not pre-exist) if it does it wouldn't be changed.

#### Step 2 - Requirements (where you initiate the script)
  * Ansible 1.7
  * Sshpass
  * PWGen
  * XMLStarlet
  * Curl
  * Python Passlib Library
  * Nmap
  * Git-core

Below are installation instructions for Debian/Ubuntu and MacOS X. However, it's possible to keep on using your preferred OS, just find the above packages and you'll be good to go.

##### Install these on Debian/Ubuntu

	apt-get install python-dev build-essential python-pip pwgen xmlstarlet curl sshpass nmap python-passlib
	pip install ansible

##### Install these on MacOS X (using Homebrew)

	brew install ansible
	brew install xmlstarlet
	brew install nmap
	brew install pwgen
	brew install https://raw.github.com/eugeneoden/homebrew/eca9de1/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb (Homebrew doesn't want to merge this https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/9577 but it's what Ansible uses)
	brew install python
	pip install passlib

#### Step 3 - Download and run the script
First download the script:

	git clone git clone https://github.com/GleSYS/wp-auto-deploy.git

Then add your API credentials to ./cluster/deploy.sh where it says:
```
	#API Credentials 
	
	API_USER="PLACE YOUR GLESYS PROJECT ID HERE: "
	API_KEY="PLACE YOUR API KEY HERE: "

```
Finally, run the script (be sure to meet the requirements above):

	./deploy.sh USERNAME FQDN (for example: ./deploy.sh wp_user blog.domain.com)
